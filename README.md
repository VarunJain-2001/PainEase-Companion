# PainEase Companion

**Goal**: To achieve a pain-free life through an AI Therapist with the human touch.

**Idea**: Making an AI Model System which can enhance the way of living with the help of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Project Overview

PainEase Companion is an innovative project that aims to combine the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with the goal of improving the quality of life, providing pain relief, and promoting overall well-being. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies and a human-centric approach to create an AI Therapist.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Therapy**: PainEase Companion offers AI-driven therapy to address and alleviate various pain-related concerns. It understands and assists users in managing pain effectively.

- **Human Touch**: While it's driven by AI, PainEase Companion strives to provide a human touch to its interactions, making it a more personal and empathetic companion.

- **Video Analysis**: The project uses computer vision capabilities through OpenCV and Mediapipe to analyze user movements and postures, helping to identify potential pain triggers.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: By incorporating Machine Learning techniques, PainEase Companion provides personalized insights and recommendations to improve the user's daily life.

- **Multimedia Integration**: It can convert the generated insights into video format, making it easier to visualize and understand the AI's recommendations.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including OpenCV, Mediapipe, and NumPy. You can install them via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```

2. **Usage**: Open the Jupyter Notebook file "live.ipynb" and follow the instructions provided within the notebook. Run the functions step by step, keeping in mind that the order of execution may vary based on your specific needs and project requirements.

3. **Video Output**: Use the `output_video.release` function to generate video output with the AI's recommendations. The resulting video will be saved in the same directory.
